Key takeaways include:

Budget Impact: Schools with lower per-student budgets consistently exhibit lower average scores and passing rates. This suggests that adequate funding is essential for enhancing educational outcomes, highlighting the need for targeted financial support in underfunded institutions.

School Size Influence: Smaller schools tend to demonstrate higher passing rates in both math and reading. This may indicate that smaller class sizes allow for more personalized instruction, fostering better student engagement and learning experiences.

Type of School: Charter schools outperform district schools in all performance metrics, suggesting that different educational models may have distinct advantages. This insight could inform policy decisions and resource allocation.

Overall, the data underscores the need for continued evaluation of the factors influencing student performance. By addressing budget disparities and exploring the benefits of smaller class sizes, educational leaders can develop targeted strategies to improve academic achievement across the board. This report serves as a foundation for future discussions aimed at enhancing the quality of education and ensuring that all students have access to the resources they need to succeed.
