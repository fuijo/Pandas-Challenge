# Pandas challenge
**PyCitySchools Analysis**
This project utilized Python’s Pandas library to analyze school performance data, offering insights into district-wide standardized test scores and identifying trends based on various metrics. The findings were presented as comprehensive data summaries, complemented by a written analysis to inform strategic decisions on school budgets and priorities.

**Deliverables**
**District Summary:**

**Metrics:**
Total number of unique schools.
Total number of students.
Total budget.
Average math and reading scores.
Percentage of students passing math, reading, and both.

**Highlights:**
A holistic view of district-wide performance to identify overall trends and areas for improvement.

**School Summary:**

**Metrics:**
Individual school performance, categorized by type, size, and per-student spending.
Average test scores and percentage of students passing.

**Insights:**
Schools with higher per-student spending and smaller sizes generally demonstrated higher passing rates.

**Performance Ranking:**

**Top 5 and Bottom 5 Schools:**
Ranked based on the percentage of students passing both math and reading.

**Key Observations:**
High-performing schools were typically smaller with focused resources, while larger schools faced challenges in achieving higher passing rates.

**Scores by Grade Level:**

**Math and Reading Scores by Grade:**
Tracked average scores across 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grades for each school.

**Trends:**
Consistency in scores was observed in higher-performing schools, while variability was noted in lower-performing schools.
Impact of Spending on Performance:

**Analysis:**
Grouped schools into spending categories: <$585, $585-630, $630-645, and $645-680.
Calculated average scores and passing rates for each category.

**Findings:**
Moderate spending ($585–$630 per student) achieved the best balance of cost and performance.
Excessive spending did not guarantee significantly better outcomes.
Impact of School Size on Performance:

**Analysis:**
Categorized schools as small (<1000), medium (1000–2000), and large (2000–5000).

**Findings:**
Smaller schools consistently outperformed larger schools in all metrics, highlighting the benefits of personalized attention.
Performance by School Type:

**Comparison:**
Public vs. charter schools.

**Insights:**
Charter schools demonstrated higher average scores and passing rates compared to public schools.
Two Key Trends Identified

**School Size and Performance:**

Smaller schools had higher passing rates in math and reading, likely due to more focused instruction and better resource allocation per student.

**Spending vs. Outcomes:**

Moderate per-student spending produced better performance, while excessive spending showed diminishing returns, indicating that strategic budgeting is more critical than simply increasing expenditures.
Summary
The analysis provided a detailed understanding of district and school-level performance, offering actionable insights for budget allocation and strategic planning. By leveraging Pandas for data manipulation and visualization, this project illustrated the power of data-driven decision-making in the education sector.
